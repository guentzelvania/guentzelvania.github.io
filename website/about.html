      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> I am a marketing professional from the Pittsburgh Area. I am the oldest of 4 sisters, 
      and I have 3 cats. I love sports, especially soccer and hockey. I am a huge fan of the 
      Pittsburgh Penguins and The Portland Thorns. I also enjoy traveling and trying new foods. 
      I have a passion for web development and design, and I am always looking for new opportunities 
      to learn and grow in this field. I am a plant lover and have a small collection of succulents and 
      houseplants that I care for. I am also a coffee enthusiast and enjoy trying different blends and 
      brewing methods. Overall, I am a creative and driven individual who is excited to share my work and 
      connect with others in the industry through this portfolio website!
